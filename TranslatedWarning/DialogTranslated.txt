-BombsContentEvent.2
+Please make this a series! That thing with the bombs was very scary

-BombsContentEvent.3
+A spooktuber is never truly a real spooktuber until they've seen a monster with bombs on it

+Weirdo things = amazing bomb guy!

-BombsContentEvent.16
+Honestly, just the bomb monster being kind of annoyed at you was the most convincing part. Realistically.

-BombsContentEvent.17
+The thing that scared me the most was the fact that there were multiple bombs on a single monster

-BombsContentEvent.18
+Bombs!

-BombsContentEvent.19
+Bombs?

-BombsContentEvent.20
+if you dont make this a series i will genuinely explode. jk

-WeepingContentEventSuccess.1
+Awh the robot just wanted to watch you all on spooktube
