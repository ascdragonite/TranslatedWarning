+As an extremely anxious person I dont think I would like to meet that thing

-2539
+Why does it move like that??

-6187
+Please make this a series! That thing with the bombs was very scary

-8611
+A spooktuber is never truly a real spooktuber until they've seen a monster with bombs on it

-4584
+Kind of messed up that it throws explosive bombs

-4664
+I don't believe in bomb monsters, but I do right now

-5101
+It sounds like you barked but it was just an explosion

-10997
+I have actually lived next to a bomb factory my whole life, its always given me shivers, i have alot of respect for you!

-7180
+This video is amazing, Def my favorite from you now, I hope it gets more views!!

-3025
+Weirdo things = amazing bomb guy!

-9907
+Honestly, just the bomb monster being kind of annoyed at you was the most convincing part. Realistically.

-9057
+The thing that scared me the most was the fact that there were multiple bombs on a single monster

-532
+Bombs!

-562
+Bombs?

-5480
+if you dont make this a series i will genuinely explode. jk

-5467

-4799
+Does anyone know what the bird looking monster is??

-3417
+I dont think it likes the flashlight!

-4389
+I believe being this close to fire is dangerous

-3460
+Me when I find hairspray and a lighter

-4702
+When you find that bigassed spider in your house...

-4988
+What a beautiful destructive power. Good video for me

-5313
+This looks like an easy way to start a forest fire. OR WORSE

+Thats just a person in a white sheet.

-7685
+That figure in the white sheet needs to audition for the next horror blockbuster.

-5157
+KNIFE! Seriously, though, stay safe out there, explorers!

-6645
+Ghost or not, that figure in the white sheet is the stuff of nightmares!

-6238
+Do you think it's a local legend or just a creepy coincidence?. Knife

-932
+Knife guy!!

-3284
+Stab ghost is so by far my favorute!

-5192
+Cant you just talk to it! It looks like a person in there!

-7227
+Nope, nope, nope! That figure in the white sheet is haunting my dreams tonight.

-4161
+How do you stay so calm in these situations?!

-6913
+Forget haunted, that person in the white sheet needs to join a comedy club!

-7872
+It's like they're trying to be spooky but ended up being unintentionally hilarious.

-6306
+Anyway thanks for reading my comment, I am just here for knife ghost

-6161
+Extremely unsetteling that someone would have that as their job.

-7094
+These videos are so awesome. Does anyone know whats up with the sheet ghost?

-2398
+Holy sheet! Knife try! HAHAHA

-3459
+Id be scared of my pants if I was there!

-5954
+I cant believe you arent more scared of the knife ghost! KNIFE GHOST

-2222

+This is the BEST video you’ve ever made (if you ask me). Did anyone see the roof monster?

-2087
+How is it upside down??

-4419
+Spookyest creature I have ever seen. WHERE DID IT GO

-1814

-4031
+Someone said that thing is afraid if lights

-2030
+I am afraid of spiders!

-1391
+It shoots webs!

-3619
+Of course they would run into a spider!

-4593

-1272
+LESS SPIDER PLEASE

-4792
+Easily the most scary video all day! What the spider

-5733
+Just wanna mention that there is no need for a spider that big

-6195
+Exactly what I wanted to see today! Spider monster is really scary!

-7072
+This right here is professionals, facing a big spider like this with no fear

-2609
+Bet it has a poisionous bite

-3714
+I dont like how that spider moves at all!

-455
+SPIDER

-7471
+I really like how you balance your humor with spooky things like the big spider

+Wait a second.... That really large for a spider

-7558
+When you enter a having many eyes competition and your opponent is that spider..

-4414
+Honestly love these videos, wish you made more!

-6714
+That guy is filming! I think he is too mean for spööktubes guidelines!

-10442
+Seems like that guy is murder streaming. kind of fucked up if you ask me. I wouldnt not watch something like that

-4226
+RUN! Thats a kill streamer!! Dont let it get you!!

-1930
+That monster is HUGGEE

-2297
+That monster is so scary

-3742
+I wonder if that big guy is just lonely...

-1061
+He's so big...

-2731
+I wonder if he's still there???

-1798
+You invaded his HOME!

-1602
+It's disgusting...

-1435
+Leave him alone!

-4063
+I love how you terrying that monster looks

-5448
+Greetings from the sky island next to yours. nice monster

-5772
+Awesome work and scary monsters! You're so authentic and real.

-6368
+You have the most real footage... It's far superior than many others...

-3104
+This was an AMAZING investigation!!!

-5667
+Pals , everytime i see a new video of yours , im like YESSSS  ....!!  :)

-7097
+Incredible! I watch a lot of paranormal monster channels but you are special

-6204
+Totally agree with the other comments, fantastic monster channel

-4815
+Your way of dealing with big monsters, excellent...!!!

-3569
+WOW What a BIG monster! Please be careful!

-5904
+Thankyou SO much for recording this!! To scary for me to go there!

-6108
+Omg I never had that many chills watching other spooktube videos!

-5138
+Holy cow. Why do you do these FOR REAL?! That thing was huge!

-4901
+I thought it looked at you!! It looked very dangerous!

-4727
+wow they are so brave, just taunting that monster!

-3823
+Hahaha put that thing back in the toolbox

-1571
+I think it FELL OVER

-3404
+Laughing so hard at the wisk monster

-5224
+Only my first video I see but I liked the machine monster

-2794
+Never change lol. Good footage!

-4739
+That thing was probably used to make things before

-5567
+I swear this is my favorite creature. Its such a weird shape!

-6803
+I rarely get scared and I guess I didn't really get scared this time either

-5975
+You already know they are gonna run into some freaky creatures!

-1486
+MORE VIDEOS! WISK HEAD

-2978
+Its the wisk head monster for me

-1570
+Not the wisk head

-5683
+Do people realise its actually dangerous!? My uncles all died

-5258
+Can we all agree that we want to see more of the wisk head?

-3814
+Never in a million years would that be me!

-4309
+You know its serious when its wisker monster

-2320
+Favorite so far! Wisk guy!

-7655
+Maybe the real content was the friends we made along the way. Like the wall monster

-3179
+Wall thing! Lovely video everyone!

-6625
+As someone who owns multiple walls, I find this video quite concerning

-5098
+Not good at all that the monsters come out of the walls

-2469
+OMG the big robot is crying!

-2826
+That big cage guy is real scary

-2516
+I think the big robot is sad

-2178
+The big robot is crying!

-2513
+The big robot is crying! Aww

-3196
+The big robot is crying! Poor thing

-4093
+That big robot cage want's to kidnap someone

-1984
+OMG they got captured!

-3350
+Did you manage to sovle the Capthca??

-4908
+Omg I cant believe you didnt stay away from the robot

-13458
+Seriously, who designed that captcha? I've struggled with some tough ones, but this is on another level. Poor crew, hope they find a way out soon. 

-9260
+My cats wouldn't stand for this! Hoping the kids find a way to outsmart that robot and get to safety.

-10705
+Sending virtual hugs to the pals. Stay strong, and I hope there's a positive resolution to this strange situation.

-10909
+Captchas are meant to annoy, not terrify! Hope this is just a strange online challenge and not a dangerous situation.

-3262
+YOU MADE IT! The big robot is happy now!

-5209
+Awh the robot just wanted to watch you all on spooktube

-7625
+Can we talk about the irony of a robot needing help with a captcha? Humans: 1, Robot: 0

-9504
+Imagine getting kidnapped and the only way out is solving captchas! Next-level trolling by the robot.

-13393
+Forget horror movies, this is the content I signed up for on SpookTube! Kids, you're legends for turning a scary situation into a captcha comedy!

-4628
+Thank you all for helping me out! Love your videos

-1925
